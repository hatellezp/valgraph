 * TODO: define errors for each type
 *     : catch errors
 *     : write the linalg for polynomials
*     : verify that the allocation and freed of memory is correct
 *     : see gsl_message and its utility
 *     : see if the 'get' and 'set' functions cause overhead, if it is the case, then reach directly to the values
 *     : for the swapping method in the matrix module find a better way to exchange pointers than copy as is it now
 *     : !!! solve how do pyvot for Gauss-Jordan elimitation and solve for LU with polynomials... not evident at all
